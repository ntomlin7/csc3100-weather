# csc3100-weather

## Description

- This project was created for the csc3100 web development class at tennessee technological univerity.
- The overall goal was to build an online weather application that pulls in real time weather data
  based on the users location, which is then shown to that user in a pleasant and easy to read format. In addition, the web app also is available as a PWA, and as a result can be added to the 
  homescreen of mobile devices.
- This application is being hosted through github pages, and can be accessed via the following
